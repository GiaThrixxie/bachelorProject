ingredients: "The alchemist's Blood, choleric or sanguine human blood, adrenaline, ammonium carbonate, hartshorn, caffeine or benzedrine, melatonin.",
system: "The alchemist taps their vessel (Calcinatio), or their own vein (Athanor Corporis) to get the Awaken the Sleeper elixir if they do not use Fixatio. They then mix the elixir into human blood. For each success above 2 on the distillation roll, the elixir can awaken a vampire of that Blood Potency. Example: Hari gets 5 successes on his Awaken the Sleeper distillation roll: this elixir can awaken a torpid vampire of Blood Potency 3 or less (5 - 2 = 3).",
